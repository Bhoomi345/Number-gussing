# 🎯 OIBSIP_Java_Task2: Number Guessing Game

## 📌 Task Title
**Number Guessing Game** – Console-based interactive game built using Java.

## 🧠 Objective
The main goal of this task was to develop a simple number guessing game using Java to demonstrate the use of basic programming concepts like loops, conditional statements, random number generation, and user input handling. This project was completed as a part of my internship at **OIB-SIP (Oasis Infobyte Summer Internship Program)**.

## 🚀 Steps Performed

1. Initialized a Java project and created a main class `NumberGuessGame`.
2. Used the `Random` class to generate a secret number between 1 and 100.
3. Allowed the user a limited number of attempts to guess the number.
4. Displayed hints if the guess was too high or too low.
5. Tracked attempts and displayed success or failure messages accordingly.
6. Implemented input validation and replay option.
7. Recorded a short demo video of the working project for submission.
