# 🏦 OIBSIP_Java_Task3: ATM Interface

## 📌 Task Title
**ATM Interface** – A console-based ATM simulation program developed using Java.

## 🧠 Objective
The objective of this task is to simulate basic ATM functionalities using Java programming. This includes user login authentication, balance inquiry, deposits, withdrawals, money transfers, and viewing transaction history. The goal was to apply fundamental programming concepts in a real-world scenario and enhance logical thinking and coding skills.

## 🚀 Steps Performed

1. Created a Java class `ATM` to handle the core logic.
2. Implemented a login system using user ID and PIN.
3. Created a menu-driven interface for the following options:
   - View Transaction History
   - Withdraw Money
   - Deposit Money
   - Transfer Money
   - Exit/Quit
4. Used Java’s `Scanner` for input and `String` to maintain transaction history.
5. Ensured input validation for incorrect choices and insufficient balance.
6. Recorded a working demo video of the project execution.
